\description{
These are famous data published by Ludwig von Bortekewitscch in his 1898 book,
\emph{Das Gesetz der Kleinen Zahlen} ("The law of small numbers"). 20 years of data are presented
for each of 14 army corps.
}
\details{
More data on the same corps are available in a more modern data set, with 35 years of data
in the \code{hkdeaths} data frame in the \code{{HorseKicks}} package. These revised data and some analysis
are described in Antony Unwin, Bill Venables (March 2025) "Horses for courses: A fresh look at the horse-kick data"
